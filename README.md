# Instacart-Price-Optimization

Objective
Develop a price optimization system for the Instacart platform to maximize revenue, customer retention, and adoption of loyalty programs through data analysis and predictive models.

Project Steps
1. Generating Synthetic Data
To illustrate the optimization process, we created synthetic data that simulates Instacart's operational environment. This data includes information on product prices, sales, discounts, loyalty programs, customer retention, and revenue generated. These data are fundamental for training and testing our price optimization models.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before building any model, we conducted exploratory data analysis to better understand the patterns and trends. This includes:

Analyzing descriptive statistics of the data to get an overview.
Visualizing sales and revenue by product to identify which products are most popular and profitable.
Examining the adoption of loyalty programs to understand customer engagement.

3. Price Optimization Modeling
With the data prepared and understood, we built a predictive model to optimize prices. This model uses variables such as the current price after discount, loyalty program participation, and customer retention rate to predict the revenue generated. The process includes:

Splitting the data into training and test sets to evaluate the model's effectiveness.
Training a machine learning model (Random Forest) with the training data.
Evaluating the model's accuracy using performance metrics such as mean squared error and the coefficient of determination (RÂ²).

4. Price Optimization Simulation
Using the trained model, we simulated price optimization to maximize revenue. For example, we adjusted the price of a specific product by 10% and used the model to predict the resulting revenue. This step demonstrates how the system can suggest optimized prices to increase profitability.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how a price optimization system can be developed and applied at Instacart to maximize revenue, improve customer retention, and increase the adoption of loyalty programs. The process involves generating and analyzing data, building predictive models, and simulating pricing scenarios, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making.
